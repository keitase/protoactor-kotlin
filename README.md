# Proto.Actor
Ultra-fast, distributed, cross-platform actors. http://proto.actor/

## Source code
This is the Kotlin repository for Proto Actor.

Other implementations:
* [C#](https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-dotnet)
* [Go](https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-go)
* [Python (unstable/WIP)](https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-python)
* [JavaScript (unstable/WIP)](https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-js)

## How to build
```
./gradlew build
```

## Design principles

**Minimalistic API** - The API should be small and easy to use. Avoid enterprisey containers and configurations.

**Build on existing technologies** - There are already a lot of great technologies for e.g. networking and clustering. Build on those instead of reinventing them. E.g. gRPC streams for networking, Consul for clustering.

**Pass data, not objects** - Serialization is an explicit concern - don't try to hide it. Protobuf all the way.

**Be fast** - Do not trade performance for magic API trickery.

Inprocess Ping-Pong results:

## Getting started

The best place currently for learning how to use Proto.Actor is the [examples](https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-kotlin/tree/master/examples). Documentation and guidance is under way, but not yet complete, and can be found on the [website](http://proto.actor/docs/kotlin/).

### Hello world

Define a message type:

```kotlin
data class Hello(val who : String)
```

Define an actor:

```kotlin
class HelloActor : Actor
{
    suspend override fun receive(context : Context)
    {
        val msg = context.message
        when (msg)
        {
            is Hello -> println("Hello " + msg.who)
        }
    }
}
```

Spawn it and send a message to it:

```kotlin
val props = fromProducer({ HelloActor() })
val pid = spawn(props)
pid.send(Hello("Kotlin"))
```

You should see the output `Hello Kotlin`.

## Release management

### Snapshot
Commits on the master branch are deployed as snapshots to
https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local/actor/proto/ and can be consumed by adding the following configuration to your gradle file:

```
repositories {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'http://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local' }
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'actor.proto:proto-actor:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

### Releases
Tagged commits e.g. `v0.0.1` or `1.0.0-rc.1` are published to bintray and linked to jcenter.

```
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
```
